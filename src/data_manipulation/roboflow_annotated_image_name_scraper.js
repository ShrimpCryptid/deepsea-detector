/***************************************************************************************
* DESCRIPTION:
* This is a GreaseMonkey script for Firefox
* to get the names of all images that are "annotated" but not "approved" in Roboflow
* because for some reason Roboflow does not let us do this and it would be nice to not
* have to scrap the many hundreds of images we already hand-labeled.
***************************************************************************************/

/**************************************************************************************************
* USAGE:
* 0) Install GreaseMonkey in Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
*    and then promptly disable it because you probably want to be safe and not sorry
* 1) Set NUM_IMAGES to the number of images in the annotated set 
*      - You might need to set this to more than NUM_IMAGES, sometimes it repeats images
* 2) Copy this script into the GreaseMonkey script editor and save it
* 3) Navigate to the Annotate -> Dataset in the Roboflow project
* 4) Open the console window in Firefox Devtools
* 4) Enable GreaseMonkey and reload the page
* 5) Hit "ok" to start the roboflow scraper script
* 6) Navigate to the first image in the annotated section, and the scraper will start working!
			- NOTE: do NOT reload the page to run the script from this page! roboflow will include 
      				images that are not in the annotated section if this page is reloaded.
* 7) Copy the last console output with all the image names when its done.
