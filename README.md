A deep-sea creature detector for the [2022 MATE Machine Learning Satellite Challenge](https://materovcompetition.org/content/2022-mate-rov-competition-satellite-challenges).

Developed by Peyton Lee, Neha Nagvekar, and Cassandra Lam as part of the Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles Team (UWROV) at the University of Washington.

## Overview
Deepsea-Detector is built on MBARI's [Monterey Bay Benthic Object Detector](https://zenodo.org/record/5539915), which can also be found in FathomNet's [Model Zoo](https://github.com/fathomnet/models). The model is trained on data from [NOAA Ocean Exploration](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/) and [FathomNet](http://fathomnet.org/fathomnet/#/), with assistance from [WoRMS](https://www.marinespecies.org/) for organism classification. All the images and associated annotations we used can be found in our [Roboflow project](https://universe.roboflow.com/uwrov-2022-ml-challenge/deepsea-detect--mate-2022-ml-challenge).

Deepsea-Detector uses [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/) for detections and [Norfair](https://github.com/tryolabs/norfair/) for tracking.

## Installation
You'll need **Python 3.8 or higher** for this project. We use Git LFS to store some of our larger files, including the weights for our YOLOv5 model.

Open a command terminal and run the following lines:
```
git clone https://github.com/ShrimpCryptid/deepsea-detector.git
cd deepsea-detector
git lfs install; git lfs fetch; git lfs pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This downloads and installs this project and all of its dependencies.

## Running Inference
### Running via Deepsea-Detector UI
Run the following command to boot up the UI:
```
python src/deepsea_detector_ui.py
```

This will boot up the Deepsea-Detector UI! Follow the prompts to set up your output video and output comma separated value (CSV) files.

Deepsea-Detector will output a CSV file that includes the first timestamp/frame an organism appeared, its predicted classification, and the timestamp/frame of its exit from view. It will also output an MP4 video file that shows localizations (and optionally classifications as well).

### Running via Command Line Interface (CLI) or Google Colab
Our UI is a wrapper around the Deepsea-Detector CLI. This allows you to process multiple videos in sequence and define an output directory for videos. To see the full list of options and arguments, run:
```
python src/detection.py --help
```

You can also see an example in our [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ShrimpCryptid/deepsea-detector/blob/main/notebooks/Run%20Video%20Inference.ipynb), which gives you access to GPU resources for free!
