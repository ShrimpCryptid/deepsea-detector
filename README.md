# Deepsea-Detector
A deep-sea creature detector for the [2022 MATE Machine Learning Satellite Challenge](https://files.materovcompetition.org/2022/OER-2022%20ML%20_%20Computer%20Coding%20Challenge_FINAL.3.pdf).

Developed by Peyton Lee, Neha Nagvekar, and Cassandra Lam as part of the Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles Team (UWROV) at the University of Washington.

Deepsea-Detector is built on MBARI's [Monterey Bay Benthic Object Detector](https://zenodo.org/record/5539915), which can also be found in FathomNet's [Model Zoo](https://github.com/fathomnet/models). The model is trained on data from [NOAA Ocean Exploration](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/) and [FathomNet](http://fathomnet.org/fathomnet/#/). All the images and associated annotations we used can be found in our [Roboflow project](https://universe.roboflow.com/uwrov-2022-ml-challenge/deepsea-detect--mate-2022-ml-challenge).

You can find the full project source files on the [deepsea-detector GitHub](https://github.com/ShrimpCryptid/deepsea-detector).
